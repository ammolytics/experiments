# Experiment: Brass Sorting

[Part One](https://blog.ammolytics.com/2020-01-08/brass-sorting-part-one.html) investigates the relationship between Case Weight and Case Volume.

[Part Two](https://blog.ammolytics.com/2020-06-07/brass-sorting-part-two.html) leverages microstamping to track per-case performance metrics, such muzzle and target velocity.
