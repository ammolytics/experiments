# Experiment: Recoil vs Muzzle Velocity

25 rounds were fired for this experiment, which was conducted on 2018-08-27.

- 5 rounds sighters/foulers (preloaded bipod)
- 10 rounds fired with preloaded bipod technique
- 10 rounds fired with free-recoil technique

Note: The Pressure Trace II system failed to record the first sighter/fouler shot. To compensate for the discrepency, I archived this shot on the MagnetoSpeed chronograph to keep it separate from the remaining captured data.
